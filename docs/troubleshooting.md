## Known limitations
- **Latency** is about segment length plus processing time: text appears after a pause (VAD) or at `--chunk` seconds. Use `--preset chat` (or a lower `--chunk`) for faster output at the cost of more half sentences.
- **English pivot** loses terminology and nuance (two lossy hops); gender, formality and proper nouns suffer.
- **Whisper hallucinates** on silence, music and noise; mitigated by silence gating, no-speech/logprob thresholds and `condition_on_previous_text=False`, not eliminated.
- **Auto language locks** after the first recognised segment; use `--lang` for mixed-language streams.
- **CPU speed vs size**: on CPU (int8) `medium`/`large-v3` may not keep up in real time; use `--device cuda` on an NVIDIA GPU.
- **macOS** needs a virtual loopback device (no native system-audio capture API without ScreenCaptureKit helper).
- **Traditional Chinese** is converted post-hoc with OpenCC from Simplified model output, so word choice is approximate.
- Live capture backends are implemented but only `--file` is covered by automated tests (no audio hardware in CI).
